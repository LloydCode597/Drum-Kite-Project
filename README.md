# JavaScript Drum-Kite-Project

There are a number of keys here that represent different drums in a typical drum set.

And when you click on any of these buttons then you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum.

And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard.

I also added a random beat function to make it more interesting.
